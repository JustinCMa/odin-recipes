    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 thick sirloin steaks</li>
        <li>3 white onions</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tbsp beef fat or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>300 g cooked Japanese short grain white rice</li>
        <li>3 Umeboshi pickled plums</li>
        <li>4 Shiso leaves or Ooba leaves</li>
        <li>2 tbsp spring onions chopped</li>

        <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>75 ml red wine</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp water + 1 tsp corn starch</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop the onions finely.</li>
        <li>Remove the tendons from the beef and beat it with a meat tenderizer until as flat as possible.</li>
        <li>Cover meat on both sides with the chopped onion and leave for 30 minutes or more. Remove the onion and add salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook the steak to your preference(most would prefer medium-rare). Remove from heat and melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan and fry the onion used for the beef until it changes color. Adjust the flavor with salt and pepper, then move the onion to the steak.</li>
        <li>Melt the remaining butter in the frying pan and fry the sides of the meat before taking it out.</li>
        <li>Add red wine to the frying pan used for the beef to deglaze it. Boil down the wine while scraping off the meat juice.</li>
        <li>Add soy sauce and mix with everything. Adjust seasonings to personal preferences.</li>
        <li>Thicken with dissolved potato starch.</li>
        <li>Put rice mixed with Umeboshi paste (pickled plum) in the donburi bowl. Place the beef on top and add plenty of sauce. Top with the finely chopped, cooked onions.</li>
    </ol>
