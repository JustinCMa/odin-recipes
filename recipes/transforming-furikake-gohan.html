    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The dish simply is made up of eggs over rice but what makes it special is the gelatinous chicken stock or aspic that gives it much of its flavor.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>8 raw chicken wings</li>
        <li>2 tsp bonito soup stock</li>
        <li>5 cups water</li>
        <li>2 tsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sake</li>
        <li>2 tbsp gelatin</li>
        <li>1 cup white rice</li>
        <li>2 green onions</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>

        <li>Pour everything from the pan into the Broth. Simmer on medium-low for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Take the broth off the heat and let it sit for a few minutes. If there is a layer of fat on the top, take it off. Take the chicken wings out and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the gelatin to 1/2 of water and let bloom for 5 minutes. Mix the gelatin into the water until fully dissolved. Add the gelatin mix to the broth mix.</li>
        <li>Grease a tray with butter. Add the broth. Cover with cling wrap, put in the fridge and and let solidify for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Separate the chicken from the bone and skin. Add the chicken to the rice.</li>
        <li>Take the gelatin broth out of the fridge and Cut small cubes of broth gelatin.</li>
